# Contributor Guide

## Style
Wherever possible, pull logic out into unit testable functions and unit test them. 

## Testing
Run all unit tests before generating a commit.

## Commenting
Comment the code well. Comments should explain why the code is doing what it's doing, not what. Use information from the prompt and other available context to explain this. 
All Python methods should have docstrings that briefly explain what the method does, what its inputs are, and what its outputs are.

## PR instructions
Title format: [<project_name>] <Title>
