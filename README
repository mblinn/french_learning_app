# French Learning App

This repository contains a small Flask application. It exposes a single route returning "Hello, world!" and includes starter data for French flashcards. The `/flashcards` page presents these cards in an interactive layout where you can flip each card and move back and forth through the deck.

## Flashcard Data

The `flashcards.py` module defines a simple `Flashcard` dataclass and an initial set of cards:

- Le Chat → Cat
- Le Chien → Dog
- La Maison → House
- Le Homme → Man
- L'Amour → Love

These cards can be imported by future parts of the application to present them to users.

## Local Development

```bash
# Optional: create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

By default the app listens on `0.0.0.0:5000`, or you can set the `PORT` environment variable to override it.

## Deploying to Render

1. Push this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new **Web Service** on Render and connect it to your repository.
3. Use the following settings:
   - **Build command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start command:** `python app.py`

Render automatically provides the `PORT` environment variable, so the service will start successfully.
