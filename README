# French Learning App

This repository contains a small Flask application. Flashcards are fetched from
Airtable and served via the `/api/flashcards` endpoint.

## Flashcard Data

Flashcards are represented by a simple `Flashcard` dataclass containing the
French word, its English translation, the card's frequency, and learning level.

## Local Development

```bash
# Optional: create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python app.py
```

By default the app listens on `0.0.0.0:5000`, or you can set the `PORT` environment variable to override it.

## Deploying to Render

1. Push this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new **Web Service** on Render and connect it to your repository.
3. Use the following settings:
   - **Build command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start command:** `python app.py`

Render automatically provides the `PORT` environment variable, so the service will start successfully.
